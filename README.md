This script processes all txt files given as arguments thru
[multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) and converts
the output to a .docx file in the same directory.
                                                                        
Example: a folder is full of txt newsletter articles that I've written,
but now I have to give them to someone else...

## Requirements

- Mac OS X
- Fletcher Penny's [Multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) ... (you could modify it to use another Markdown variant)
